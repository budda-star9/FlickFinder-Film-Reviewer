# FlickFinder
A smart movie filtering tool with genre, language, and rating filters — built with Streamlit and scikit-learn.

This is a Streamlit-based Movie Recommendation System that lets users filter movies by genres, language, rating, and release year — and then get smart recommendations based on content similarity (TF-IDF and cosine similarity).
